    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>STEM Vibes is a teen-friendly site dedicated to encouraging teenager's curiosity and creativity in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. We believe the future belongs to young thinkers who aren't afraid to explore, ask questions, and create solutions for real-world problems.</p>

    <h2>Why STEM?</h2>
    <p>STEM education isn't just about preparing for a specific job; it's about developing a mindset. When teenagers learn STEM, they train themselves to think critically, solve complex problems, and innovate. These skills are essential in a rapidly changing world, regardless of their career path.</p>
    <p>By engaging with STEM, teenagers are building a bridge between theory and practice, transforming abstract ideas into tangible solutions. They are learning to tackle challenges with logic and creativity, preparing them to contribute to a future defined by new discoveries and groundbreaking technologies. From developing sustainable solutions for climate change to advancing space exploration or creating the next generation of life-saving medicines, a STEM background empowers teenagers to be an active participant in building a better world.</p>

    <h2>Who Is This For?</h2>
    <p>This site is for students, educators, and anyone who:</p>
	<p>💡 Like solving problems – whether it’s fixing a broken gadget, figuring out a math puzzle, or coming up with new ideas.</p>
	<p>🎮 Love tech and creativity – if you’re into gaming, coding, robotics, editing videos, or even building cool TikTok effects, that’s STEM in action.</p>
	<p>🚀 Want exciting careers – STEM leads to jobs like app developer, doctor, game designer, engineer, scientist, or even AI creator.</p>
	<p>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Just curious – you don’t have to be a “math genius.” STEM is about experimenting, asking questions, and trying new things.</p>
	<p>👉 In short: STEM is for teens who want to explore, create, and shape the future—whether that’s through science, tech, engineering, or math (or a mix of all).</p>
